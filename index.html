                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                <br>
                        <p class="lead">I am dependable, I will get the job done, and do it well.  I am the type of person who is always thinking of ways to make things more efficient. I am a natural leader, I strive to become better and help those around me so our team can improve as a whole. I have a lot of happy energy, I never meet a stranger, I am very optimistic and a hard worker.</p>
                        <h2>Sales Representative: August 2024- February 2025, August 2025</h2>
                        <p class="lead">This job was really hard, but I am happy to know that I can do hard things. Going door to door in the heat of Arkansas taught me to stay on top of my own mental attitude, be in charge of my own schedule, hard work, and success. Then after awhile, it didn’t even seem hard and I have come to enjoy it, and recognize that this is a position which has helped me grow some of my talents.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Missionary Training Center : July 2023 - August 2024</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Together, missionaries and I studied and applied the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My goal was to help them internalize the Teachings of Christ so they could come closer to Christ and invite others to do the same all over the world.

                        <h2>Research Assistant : June 2023 - Nov 2023</h2>
                        <p class="lead">I assisted BYU alumni Robin Young by setting up platforms for sharing her research. She is a wonderful mentor and trailblazer. I have learned much about working hard on things I am not qualified to do, then becoming the person who can achieve the end goal anyway. I loved stretching myself. I have learned many new skill sets, which include: building a curriculum anyone can understand, understanding difficult concepts so I can break them down, recruiting team members, leading productive discussions, building websites, advertising, and recording video lectures.

                        <p class="lead">My experience in effectively mentoring and communicating with others is extensive. In this job I coached my peers to perform to the best of their abilities. I also worked to fulfill the purposes of our organization and evaluate the happiness of my peers and the success of our collective efforts.

                        <p class="lead">My official duties included sanitizing tools, setting up rooms, doing a preliminary exam and XRays, and assisting the Hygienists and the Doctor. I was able to really hone my skill of observing needs and taking care of them. This was a new office so I was able to be really involved and realize that I am a very fast learner. I will do a good job no matter what task I am assigned.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Big Don’s Pizza : May 2020 - Septs 2020</h2>
